I am currently a student studying AI and Machine learning at IT HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. This began Autumn term 2022.
I have always wanted to pursue a career in the Tech world! In being given the opportunity to study AI and Machine learning I believe that many exciting positions will be available to myself.
It would be amazing if I could use this new information to be able to help people in some way or another, whether this may be within the health industry or environmentally.
I hope to be able to continue learning through my future career and be able to inspire others into the ever evolving Tech world!
